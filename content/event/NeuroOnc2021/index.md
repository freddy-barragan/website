summary: "My poster presentation on concurrent survival disparities by race/ethnicity and sex in pediatric brain tumors for the 5th Neuro-Oncology Symposium at the University of Minnesota."

abstract: "There are documented differences in pediatric brain tumor survival by race/ethnicity. We previously reported on sex differences in pediatric ependymoma survival. However, it is unknown whether there are pediatric cancer survival disparities when defined by race/ethnicity and sex categories. Using SEER (2000-2014) data, we estimated survival differences between race/ethnicity-sex groupings (non-Hispanic White [NHW], non-Hispanic Black [NHB], Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander [API], males and females) for 4 brain tumors diagnosed in children aged 0-19 years."
