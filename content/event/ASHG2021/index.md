This is a poster presentation on survival disparities by race/ethnicity in pediatric blood cancers for the 2021 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Human Genetics. The work presented is actually a subset of a couple projects I've done under my PIs: [Lindsay Williams](https://med.umn.edu/bio/epidemiology/lindsay-williams), [Kelsey Grinde](https://kegrinde.github.io), and [Logan Spector](https://med.umn.edu/bio/pediatrics-a-z/logan-spector). And our collaborators, [Lauren Mills](https://www.msi.umn.edu/users/ljmills), [Andrew Raduski](https://experts.umn.edu/en/persons/andrew-raduski), and [Erin Marcotte](https://med.umn.edu/bio/pediatrics-a-z/erin-marcotte). If you'd like to check our results out, stay tuned (until it's published)!
