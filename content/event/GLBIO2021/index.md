**Workshop Description**


Conferences are an essential component to the computational biology and bioinformatics communities. However, for first-time attendees, conferences may be intimidating and challenging to navigate. GLBIO has a long tradition of encouraging student/trainee participation.  In fact, for many such attendees, GLBIO may be their first experience with an academic conference. The aim for this tutorial would be to provide first time conference attendees with additional information on how to navigate the meeting in order get the most out of the experience, and to build a cohort of trainees that will reduce isolation and provide ongoing support and social opportunity. Participants will work in small groups to practice talking about their work and navigating casual conversations at the conference. With much or all of the 2021 GLBIO meeting likely to be virtual, the importance of building tools for engagement is even more critical. Ultimately, we hope to increase and enhance participation in the meeting by first time attendees, in particular undergraduate students.
