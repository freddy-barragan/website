Since Summer 2020, I have been an undergraduate research assistant for Dr. Logan Spector, Dr. Lindsay Williams, and Dr. Lauren Mills in the Division of Epidemiology \& Clinical Research at the University of Minnesota. Broadly, our work is principally focused on identifying survival disparities in pediatric cancers and their corresponding genetic basis. In January 2021, I applied to the Mann-Hill Fellowship to help fund and develop my researchâ€” I got it! I was the inaugural fellow of the program and with its help, I've matured in some really profound ways.

From the bottom of my heart, this fellowship has been so intellectually rewarding as a low-income transgender, underrepresented minority, in biostatistics, but the friendship, support, and guidance from my mentors has made it an unforgettable personal experience as well. 

In any case, this section is a snapshot of all the pretty, interesting, and cool plots I've made and loved. 

Note: Because our research is ongoing, I've obscured titles and axis legends. For more plots and their relevant context, read my honors thesis in Spring 2022!
