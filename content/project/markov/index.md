NOTE: In iterative progress (following grading).

This bookdown on discrete Hidden Markov Models & their applications to statistical genetics is my capstone! I made this bookdown on discrete Hidden Markov Models & their applications to statistical genetics for my Mathematical Statistics capstone.

The target audience for this project is introductory statistics students, so expect some looser notation and word-heavy explanations. 

Content was written and gathered by myself with appropriate citations for print materials. Wherever possible, I try to provide direct links for any digital materials or resources.

So many thank you's to my professor & mentor Kelsey Grinde. She's the best :)
