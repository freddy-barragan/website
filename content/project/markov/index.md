NOTE: In progress, so expect some typos.

I made this bookdown on discrete Hidden Markov Models & their applications to statistical genetics for my Mathematical Statistics capstone! The target audience for this project is introductory statistics students, so expect some looser notation and word-heavy explanations.  

Content was written and gathered by myself with appropriate citations for print materials. Wherever possible, I try to provide direct links for any digital materials or resources.  

This is what I was listening to in the writing process!

So many thank you's to my professor & mentor Kelsey Grinde for helping me choose this topic. She's the best :)
