I'm a junior Applied Math & Statistics major & Community & Global Health concentrator at Macalester College. Currently, I'm researching survival disparities & epigenomic trends in pediatric cancers for the University of Minnesota's Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research.

In the longterm, I want to study health disparities for low-income, minoritized, LGBTQ+ communities using rigorous statistical methods. Outside of research, I love making digital art, drinking monster, and making spotify playlists!
