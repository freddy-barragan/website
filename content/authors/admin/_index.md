I'm a first-year PhD student at the University of Washington's [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/). Currently, I'm working on machine learning methods aimed to minimize racial disparities in suicide risk modeling under [Yates Coley](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/r-coley). Previously, I was a Statistics major at Macalester College in Saint Paul, MN where I received my BA in May 2022.

While at Macalester, I had the pleasure of working with the University of Minnesota's fabulous Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research on multiple projects concerning the epidemiology of pediatric cancer. Broadly, I worked on the application of admixture mapping, gene expression analysis, and survival modeling to study and identify racial and sex-based disparities in pediatric cancer incidence and outcome.

In the longterm, I will be studying Bayesian methods to address missing data and sample size limitations in the context of urban health studies on transgender, HIV+, and nonwhite communities. Outside of research, I love making digital art, drinking monster, organizing spotify playlists, and reading critical/revolutionary theory. My greatest passion, however, is being silly and having fun :)
